## Project Purpose

**Stellar Forge** is a custom-built game engine designed to power networked video games,
like **R-Type: Reborn**. It was created to support modern game development techniques,
such as multi-threading, network synchronization, and real-time 2D rendering, all while
offering flexibility for game designers using the **Orion Editor**.

This engine allows us to modernize classic games like R-Type by enabling new game
mechanics, improved graphics, and optimized performance, while demonstrating best
practices in software engineering.

- **CMake** for building the project
- **Raylib** for graphics, audio and input (For the 3D Game Engine)
- **GLM** (OpenGL Mathematics) for vector and matrix operations

You can install the dependencies using your platform's package manager or follow the
official documentation for each tool.
