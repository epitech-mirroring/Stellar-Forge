## Project Purpose

**Stellar Forge** is a custom-built game engine designed to power networked video games, like **R-Type: Reborn**. It was created to support modern game development techniques, such as multi-threading, network synchronization, and real-time 2D rendering, all while offering flexibility for game designers using the **Orion Editor**.

This engine allows us to modernize classic games like R-Type by enabling new game mechanics, improved graphics, and optimized performance, while demonstrating best practices in software engineering.
